          <h3>Here's some facts about Ennio Morricone</h3>
          <p>Morricone was born in Rome, the son of Libera Ridolfi and Mario Morricone, a musician. At the time of his birth Italy was under fascist rule.
            His family came from Arpino, near Frosinone. Morricone had four siblings — Adriana, Aldo, Maria, and Franca — and lived in Trastevere in the centre of Rome. 
            His father was a professional trumpeter who performed in light-music orchestras while his mother set up a small textile business.
            During his early schooldays, Morricone was also a classmate of his later collaborator Sergio Leone.
          </p>
          <p>Morricone's father first taught him to read music and to play several instruments. He entered the Saint Cecilia Conservatory to take trumpet lessons 
            under the guidance of Umberto Semproni. He formally entered the conservatory in 1940 at age 12, enrolling in a four-year harmony program that he completed 
            within six months. He studied the trumpet, composition, and choral music under the direction of Goffredo Petrassi, to whom Morricone would later dedicate concert pieces.
          </p>
          <p>Morricone wrote his first compositions when he was six years old and he was encouraged to develop his natural talents.
            In 1946, he composed "Il Mattino" ("The Morning") for voice and piano on a text by Fukuko, first in a group of seven "youth" Lieder.</p>
          <p>
            Morricone's career as an arranger began in 1950, by arranging the piece Mamma Bianca (Narciso Parigi). On occasion of the "Anno Santo" (Holy Year), 
            he arranged a long group of popular songs of devotion for radio broadcasting.

          <p>
            After graduation in 1954, Morricone started to write and arrange music as a ghost writer for films credited to already well-known composers, 
            while also arranging for many light music orchestras of the RAI television network, working especially with Armando Trovajoli, Alessandro Cicognini, 
            and Carlo Savina. He occasionally adopted Anglicized pseudonyms, such as Dan Savio and Leo Nichols.

            There was no greater director-composer partnership than Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone. It was through his long-term collaboration with the late 
            filmmaker that Morricone created his most iconic scores and helped define the sound of the Spaghetti Western, 
            the Italian film movement spearheaded by Leone and his so-called «Dollars Trilogy» starring Clint Eastwood: 1964’s <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>, 
            1965’s <i>For a Few Dollars More</i>, and 1966’s <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>.
