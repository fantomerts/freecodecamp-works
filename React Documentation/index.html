            <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. 
                Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the 
                links in this section will help you get started.</p>
            <p>When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!</p>
            <p>As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for 
                larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem.</p>
            <p>People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, 
                we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you prefer to <strong>learn by doing</strong>, start with our practical tutorial.</li>
                <li>If you prefer to <strong>learn concepts step by step</strong>, start with our guide to main concepts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you <i>will</i> get the hang of it.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Add_React_to_a_Website">
            <header id="section-header"><h3>Add React to a Website</h3></header>
            <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as much React as you need</strong>. 
                Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.</p>
            <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <i>div</i> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:</p>
            <code>
                <xmp><!-- ... existing HTML ... --></xmp>
                <xmp><div id="like_button_container"></div></xmp>
                <xmp><!-- ... existing HTML ... --></xmp>
            </code><code></code><code></code><code></code>
            <p>Before deploying your website to production, be mindful that unminified JavaScript can significantly slow down the page for your users. 
                If you already minify the application scripts, your site will be production-ready if you ensure that the deployed HTML 
                loads the versions of React ending in <i>production.min.js</i></p>
            <p>Adding JSX to a project doesn’t require complicated tools like a bundler or a development server. Essentially, adding JSX 
                <strong>is a lot like adding a CSS preprocessor</strong>. The only requirement is to have <i>Node.js</i> installed on your computer.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Create_a_New_React_App">
            <header id="section-header"><h3>Create a New React App</h3></header>
            <p>Create React App is a comfortable environment for <strong>learning React</strong>, and is the best way to start building 
                <strong>a new single-page application</strong> in React.</p>
            <p>Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it 
                with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses <i>Babel</i> and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.</p>
            <p>The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neutrino</strong> combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components.</li>
                <li><strong>Nx</strong> is a toolkit for full-stack monorepo development, with built-in support for React, Next.js, Express, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Parcel</strong> is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React.</li>
                <li><strong>Razzle</strong> is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:</p>
            <code>
                <xmp><script crossorigin src=""></script></xmp>
                <xmp><script crossorigin src=""></script></xmp>
            </code>
            <p>To load a specific version of <i>react</i> and <i>react-dom</i>, replace <i>17</i> with the version number.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Release_Channels">
            <header id="section-header"><h3>Release Channels</h3></header>
            <p>React relies on a thriving open source community to file bug reports, open pull requests, and 
                submit RFCs. To encourage feedback we sometimes share special builds of React that include unreleased features.</p>
            <p>All releases are published to npm, but only Latest uses semantic versioning. Prereleases (those in the Next and Experimental 
                channels) have versions generated from a hash of their contents and the commit date, e.g. <i>0.0.0-68053d940-20210623</i> for 
                Next and <i>0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623</i> for Experimental.</p>
            <p>The only officially supported release channel for user-facing applications is Latest. Next and Experimental releases are provided
                 for testing purposes only, and we provide no guarantees that behavior won’t change between releases. They do not follow the semver
                  protocol that we use for releases from <i>Latest</i>.</p>
            <p><strong>Latest</strong> is the channel used for stable React releases. It corresponds to the latest tag on npm. It is the recommended channel 
                for all React apps that are shipped to real users.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Next</strong> channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. We use prereleases in the Next channel as release 
                candidates for the Latest channel. You can think of Next as a superset of Latest that is updated more frequently.</p>
            <p>Experimental features may or may not be documented. Usually, experiments aren’t documented until they are close to shipping in Next or Latest.</p>
            <p>We will post to the <strong>React blog</strong> when we’re ready to announce new experiments, but that doesn’t mean we will publicize every experiment.</p>
